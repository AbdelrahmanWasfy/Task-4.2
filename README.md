# Campus Marketplace — ACL UI/UX Lab

This is a **standalone React demo** for one session of the UI/UX Rescue Challenge. It uses realistic example records stored in this browser; it does not connect to MongoDB or the previous lab API.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The terminal prints **one local URL**. Open that link in your normal external browser. The development server will **not** open a browser automatically. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

## Functional brief

Users browse listings; creating, editing and marking their own item sold must work. Keep prices numeric and non-negative. A new listing starts active; only the owner may edit it.

### Fields from the prior lab

- `title` — Item title: required text
- `price` — Price: non-negative number
- `category` — Category: textbooks, electronics, furniture, clothing, other
- `condition` — Condition: new, like-new, used, worn
- `description` — Description: optional
- `pickup` — Item-specific pickup/meetup location (extra field for this standalone demo)
- `status` — Status: active or sold when editing

The demo supports create/edit and stores your updates in browser `localStorage` for this browser. The current demo account email is filled automatically in the Sell form; no separate contact-email entry is needed. Contact Seller opens the default email application with a sample recipient address; it does not send an in-app message. Existing example listings use remote stock photos, which require an internet connection; an icon fallback appears if an image cannot load. **Reset demo** restores the example records. You can assume the current signed-in user is `You`.

## User scenario for this session

A student wants to compare second-hand campus items, find an affordable listing and publish an item of their own.

Your redesign should support the scenario above without removing or weakening the existing features.

## UI/UX Rescue Challenge (25–30 minutes)

**Your mission:** use this interface as an end user, find **at least three distinct, meaningful UI/UX problems**, and fix all three with AI assistance.

- Explain the user's goal and why each issue hurts usability.
- Ask AI to suggest alternatives and compare trade-offs before you implement a solution.
- Choose your own changes; there is no prescribed visual redesign.
- Preserve all working behavior and relevant validation.
- Demonstrate the main action, one unsuccessful action, and your three improvements.

**Submit:** the modified React files, before/after screenshots, three brief justifications, and one example of an AI design suggestion you refined or rejected.

**Evaluation:** We assess usability reasoning, design consistency, preserved functionality, and testing. Using AI is allowed and expected. Cosmetic changes alone are not sufficient.
